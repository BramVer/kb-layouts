# DEFAULT LAYOUT

This is the stock setup provided by the manufacturer, saved from [this gist](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/698782f9ccb07e9c4ad36ebd3ce0c267).

**Note:** 
- I removed the author-part from the original dump from kb-layout-editor, since [kbfirmware](http://kbfirmware.com/) said it was an incorrect layout.
- You will have to adjust the rowsize, since something didn't translate so well when it got dumped. It's seen as one big keyboard w/out layers atm, you'll have to change that yourself.

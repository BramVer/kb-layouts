# XD75reee LAYOUT - rev02

After using it a lot, I noticed some annoyances.

- Mouse cannot be controlled when using board onehanded (mods too far away).
- Mouse only controllable from left side.
- No RGB indications of layer
- Funny macro was funny but for some reason locked the layer it was on.
- No emoji support (((rip)))

These are the points I focused on mostly.

The Keymap was cleaned up a bit as well.

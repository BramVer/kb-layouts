# Quefrency Flashing

I got both the 60% and 65% right halves, but I don't think there will be an issue with flashing double layouts. 
The docs provided by [keebio](https://keeb.io) are great, so I'd just point you over there.

## Remarks
**Initially, both pro micros need to be flashed**, in order to communicate with each other.  
After this though, only the master needs to be updated whenever you want to flash a new keymap.

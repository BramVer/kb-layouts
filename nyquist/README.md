# Nyquist Flashing

The docs provided by [keebio](https://keeb.io) are great, even though they're marked as incomplete  
and only provide a build log rather than actual instructions.

## Useful links
- [Flashing firmware](https://docs.keeb.io/#/flashing-firmware)

## Remarks
**Initially, both pro micros need to be flashed**, in order to communicate with each other.  
After this though, only the master needs to be updated whenever you want to flash a new keymap.
